## Problem Statement ❗

The Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository contains a vast amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal of this project is to extract, process, and visualize this data in a user-friendly manner. The solution must include steps for data extraction, transformation, database insertion, and dashboard creation. The dashboard should provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

## Approach 📝

1. **Data Extraction:** Clone the GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data.
2. **Data Transformation:** Pre-process and clean the data using Python and Pandas.
3. **Database Insertion:** Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Use Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard.
5. **Data Retrieval:** Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. **Deployment:** Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Deploy the dashboard publicly for accessibility.

## Results 📈

The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays insights from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate through different visualizations. The dashboard will provide valuable insights and information for data analysis and decision-making.

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Access the dashboard from the provided URL.
